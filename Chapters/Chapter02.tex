\chapter{Introduction}

Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) \citep{Kanerva1988} is a mathematical model of long-term memory that has a number of neuroscientific and psychologically plausible dynamics. It has been applied in many different fields, like pattern recognition \citep{norman2003modeling, rao1995natural}, noise reduction \citep{Meng2009}, handwriting recognition \citep{fan1997genetic}, robot automation \citep{Rajesh1998, mendes2008robot}, and so forth. Despite all those applications, there is not a reference implementation which would allow one to replicate the results published in a paper, to check the source code for details, and to improve it. Thus, even though intriguing results have been achieved using SDM, it requires great effort of researchers to improve someone's work.

It is our belief that such a tool could bring orders of magnitude more researchers and attention if they were able to use the model, at zero cost, with an easy to use high-level language such as python. Neuroscientists interested in long-term memory storage should not have to worry about high-bandwidth vector parallel computation.  This new tool provides a ready to use system in which experiments can be executed almost as soon as they are designed.

Our motivation was our own effort in order to run our models. As there is no reference implementation, we had to implement our own and run several simulations to ensure that our implementation was correct and bug free. Thus, we had to deviate from our main goal --- which was to test our models --- and to focus in the implementation itself. Furthermore, new members in our research group had to go through different source codes developed by former members.

The main contribution of this work is a reference implementation which yields (i) orders of magnitude gains in performance, (ii) has several backends and operations, (iii) has automatic tests, (iv) is cross-platform, and (v) is easily extended to fulfill other research models. Our reference implementation may, hopefully, accelerate research into the model's dynamics and make it easier for readers to replicate any previous results and easily understand the source-code of the model.  Moreover, new machanisms and applications are also introduced.

SDM, extensions of it, has been used in many applications. For example, \citet{Snaider2011} extended SDM to efficiently store sequences of vectors and trees.  \citet{Rajesh1998} used SDM in an autonomous robot. \citet{Meng2009} modified SDM to clean patterns from noisy inputs. \citet{Linhares2011} showed that SDM respects the limits of short-term memory discussed by \citet{Miller1955} and \citet{Cowan2001}.

\chapter{Framework Architecture}

The framework implements the basic operations in a Sparse Distributed Memory which may be used to create more complex operations. It is developed in C language and the OpenCL parallel framework --- which may be loaded in many platforms and programming languages --- with a wrapper in Python. The Python module makes it easy to create and execute simulations in a Sparse Distributed Memory and works properly in Jupyter Notebook \citep{kluyver2016jupyter}. It works in both Python 2 and Python 3.

We split the SDM memory in two parts: the hard-location addresses and the hard-location counters. Thus, the addresses (bitstrings) of the hard-locations are stored in one array, while their counters in another. This makes possible to create multiple SDMs using the same address space, which would save computational effort to scan a bitstring in all the SDMs --- since they share the same address space, the activated hard-locations will be same in all of them. As the slowest part of reading and writing operations is scanning the address space, the performance benefits are high.

Each part may be stored either in the RAM memory or in a file. The RAM memory is interesting for quick experiments, automated tests, and others scenarios in which the SDM may be lost, while the file is interesting for a long-term SDM, like creating an SDM file with 10,000 random writes, which will be copied over and over to run multiple experiments. The file may also be sent to another researcher or may be published with the paper to let others run their own checks and verify the results. In summary, the framework fits many different uses and necessities.

Let a SDM memory with $N$ dimensions and $H$ hard-locations. Then, in a 64-bit computer, the array of hard-location addresses will use $H \cdot 8 \cdot \lceil N/64 \rceil$ bytes of memory, and there will be $H \cdot N$ hard-location counters. For example, in a SDM memory with 1,000 dimensions and 1,000,000 hard-locations, using 32-bit integers for the counters, the array of addresses will use 122MB of memory and the counters will use 3.8 GB of memory.

Basic operations were grouped in four sets: (i) for bitstrings, (ii) for addresses, (iii) for counters, and (iv) for memories (SDMs). Operations include creating new bitstrings, flipping bits, generating a bitstring with a specific distance from a given bitstring, scanning the address space using different algorithms, writing a bitstring to a counter, writing in an SDM, reading from an SDM, and iteratively reading from an SDM until convergence.


\section{Bitstring}

Bitstrings are the main structure of SDM. The addresses are represented in bitstrings, as well as the data. A bitstring is stored as an array of integers. Each integer may be 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit long, depending on the configuration. By default, each integer is 64-bit long.

For instance, a 1,000-bit bitstring will have $\lceil 1000/64 \rceil = 16$ integers. These integers will have a total of $16 \cdot 64 = 1,024$ bits. The remaining 24 bits are always zero, so they do not affect the result of any operation. Bitstrings store neither how many bits they have nor the array length. These pieces of information are only stored in the address space.


\subsection{The distance between two bitstrings}

The distance between two bitstrings is calculated by the hamming distance, which is the number of different bits between them.

It is calculated counting the number of ones in the exclusive or (xor) between the bitstrings, i.e., $d(x, y) = \text{number of ones in } x \oplus y$. There are several algorithms to calculate the number of ones \citep{warren2013hacker}, but the performance depends on the processor. So, we have implemented three different algorithms and one may be selected through compiling flags. The default algorithm is to use a builtin instruction from the compiler.

An alternative algorithm available is the lookup. It pre-calculates a table of distances --- by default, it is a 16-bit table which uses 65MB of RAM, but one may increase to a 32-bit table which uses 4GB of RAM ---, which is accessed a few times. Finally, to calculate the distance between two bitstrings, it sums the distance of each 16-bit part of the bitstrings, i.e., $d(x[0:N-1], y[0:N-1]) = d(x[0:15], y[0:15]) + d(x[16:31], y[16:31]) + \dots$. As each distance is calculated in O(1), this algorithm runs in O($\lceil bits/16 \rceil$).


\section{Address space}

An address space is a fixed collection of bitstrings, and each bitstring represents a hard-location address. They store the number of bitstrings, as well as the number of bits, number of integers per bitstring, and the number of remaining bits.

Bitstrings are stored in a contiguous array of 64-bit integers, as shown in Figure \ref{tab:hl-addresses-detail}. Hence, basic pointer arithmetic provides us with performance improvements in their access, as processors realize fechts of contiguous chunks of memory  \citep{pai2004linux}.

\end{figure}

The scan for activated hard-locations is performed in an address space. It returns the indexes of the bitstrings which were inside the circle. Then, each operation uses this index in a different way.

\subsection{Scanning for activated hard-locations}

Scanning for the activated hard-locations is a problem similar to well-known problems in computational geometry called ``range reporting in higher dimensions''. In this case, none of the known algorithms is able to solve our problem faster than $O(n)$. The algorithm which seems to best fit in our problem consumes $O(n)$ space and runs in $O(\log^d(n))$ \citep{chazelle1988functional}, which is really slower than $O(n)$ when, for instance, $n=1,000,000$ and $d=1,000$. For a review of the algorithms, see \citet{chan2011orthogonal}.

In 2014, there was published a solution to fast search in hamming space which seems applicable to our problem \citet{norouzi2014fast}. It provides a fast search when $r/b < 0.11$ or $r/b < 0.06$, where $r$ is the radius and $b$ is the number of bits. But, in our case, for a 1,000 bits SDM, $r/b = 0.451$, which changes the runtime to $O(n^{0.993})$. This is really close to $O(n)$, but with a larger constant. Hence, $O(n)$ is still faster.

It is intriguing that none of those algorithms is able to solve our scanning problem. The idea behind those computational geometry algorithms is roughly to split the search space in half each step, which would take $O(\log(n))$ to go through the whole space. But this approach does not work because of the high number of dimensions (i.e., 1,000) and because the hardlocations' addresses are randomly sampled from the $\{0, 1\}^d$ space. So, each addresses' bit itself splits the hardlocations in half, but it does not split the search space in half since both halves still must be convered by the algorithm. For instance, let's say we have 1,000 dimensions with 1,000,000 hardlocations, and we are scanning within a circle with radius 451, then after checking the first bit we have two cases: (i) for the half with the same first bit, we must keep scanning with radius 451; and (ii) for the half with a different first bit, we must keep scanning with radius 450. The search space has not been split in half because both halves have been covered (and one of them should have been skipped).

Hence, as our best approach is to scan through all hardlocations, we may distribute the scan into many tasks which will be executed independently. The tasks may be executed in different processes, threads, or even computers. They may also run in the CPU or in the GPU. In this case, we may take into account both the time required to distribute the tasks and the time to receive their results.

The framework implements three main scanner algorithms: linear scanner, thread scanner, and OpenCL scanner. The linear scanner runs in a single core, is the slowest one, and was developed only for testing purposes; the thread scanner runs at the CPU in multiple threads sharing memory (and our recommendation is to use the number of threads equals to twice the number of CPU cores); and the OpenCL scanner runs in multiple GPU cores and support multiple devices. The speed of a scan depends on the CPU and GPU devices, thus the best approach to choose which scanner is best for one's setup is to run a benchmark.

The OpenCL must be initialized, which just copies the address space's bitstrings to the GPU's memory. Then, many scans may be executed with no necessity to upload the bitstrings again.


\section{Counters}

Each hard-location has one integer of data per bit. For instance, each hard-location of a 1,000 bits SDM has 1,000 bits. Those integers are stores in a counter.

A counter is an array of integers which stores the data of all hard-locations. So, the counter's array has $N \cdot H$ integers.

When two counters are added in a third counter, there may occur an overflow. Counters may have overflow protection depending on compiling options. By default, there is no overflow check for performance reasons. It is not supposed to be a problem because each counter is a signed 32-bit integer which can store any number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 (and they will not overflow with less than $2^{31}-1$ divided by the number of activated hard-locations). For instance, when $N=1,000$, $H=1,000,000$, and $r=451$, the average number of activated hard-locations is 1,000 and it would require at least one million writes to be possible to overflow a counter.  Note also that it would be improbable for a hard location dimension to be this biased before the complete saturation of the memory.


\section{Read and write operations}

The reading and writing operations are executed in two steps: first, the address space is swept looking for the activated addresses; then, the operation is performed in the counters. Reading operation assemblies the bitstring according to the counters of the activated addresses, while the writing operation changes the counters.

The iterated reading keeps reading until it gets exactly the same bitstring (or the number of maximum interations has been reached), i.e., it performs $\eta_{i+1} = \text{read}(\eta_i)$ and stops when $\eta_{k+1} = \eta_{k}$. If the initial bitstring is inside the critical distance of $\eta$, it will converge to $\eta$, but, if it is not, it will diverge and reach the maximum number of iterations.

The framework is available both Kanerva's read and Chada's read. The latter was implemented according to a generalization proposed by physics professor Paulo Murilo of UFF during the discussion of my master's defense. The generalization brings a parameter $z$, which is the exponent of the counter. In this case, the results are floating point instead of integer, which considerably reduces performance. When $z=1$, it is exactly as the Kanerva's read. When $z=0$, it is the Chada's read. We also explored how SDM would behave for different values of $z$.

There is also another special read operation: the weighted reading. The weight is retrieved from a lookup table of integers based on the distance between the hard-location's address and the reading address. The weight is multiplied by the counter's value and summed. The rest of the read operation is exactly the same.



\section{Results (i): Framework Validation}

The framework has been validated comparing its results with the expected results from \citet{Kanerva1988}. Thus, we run simulations which were then compared to the theoretical analysis conducted some decades ago.

The objective here is twofold: (i) a single command will install the framework, and (ii) another single command will run (and display) the desired figures obtained the simulation. This will allow potential users to become familiarized with the system and its underlying code with barely any learning curve beyond scientific python and jupyter notebooks.

One particular analysis of interest is that of the distance read at a point $\alpha$. Suppose an SDM is trying to read an item written at $\alpha$, but the cues received so far lead to a point of distance $d$ from $\alpha$.  As one reads at $\alpha+d$, a new bitstring $\beta$ is obtained, leading to our question: what is the new distance from $\alpha$ to $\beta$? Is it smaller or larger than $d$? That, of course, depends on the ratio between $d$ and the number of dimensions of the memory.  As we have found out, there are some deviations from Kanerva's original theoretical analysis and the results obtained by simulation.

\subsection{Some initial anomalous results}

As we ran the simulations reflecting some of Kanerva's graphs, one in particular struck our attention: The new distances obtained after a read operation were not perfectly predicted by the theoretical model, and we propose that this is due to interaction effects between different attractors.

\citet{Kanerva1988} originally predicted a \textasciitilde 500-bit distance after a point (Fig. \ref{kanerva-table-7-2}). The original prediction considered that the read distance would decline when inside the critical distance in increase afterwards, converging to a \textasciitilde 500-bit distance.  At this point, each read would lead to a different, orthogonal, \textasciitilde 500-bit distance point.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images02/kanerva-table-7-2-original.png}
\caption{Kanerva's original Figure 7.3 (p. 70) predicting a \textasciitilde 500-bit distance after a point.
\label{kanerva-table-7-2}}
\end{figure}

Our preliminary results show that the theoretical prediction is not accurate.  There are interaction effects from one or more of the attractors created by the 10,000 writes, and these attractors seem to raise the distance beyond \textasciitilde 500 bits (Fig. \ref{sdm-10000w-table-7-2}). Our results were obtained using a 1,000 bit, 1,000,000 hard-location SDM with exactly 10,000 random bitstrings written into it, the same used by Kanerva.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images02/sdm-10000w-table-7-2.png}
\caption{Results generated by the framework diverging from Kanerva's original Table 7.2. Here we had a 1,000 bit, 1,000,000 hard-location SDM with exactly 10,000 random bitstrings written into it, which was also Kanerva's configuration.
\label{sdm-10000w-table-7-2}}
\end{figure}

But, when we reduced the number of random bitstrings written in the SDM from 10,000 to only 100, the results reflected very well the Kanerva's theoretical expectation (Fig. \ref{sdm-100w-table-7-2}). This result strengthens our hypothesis that the disparities in the computational results are due to the interaction effect of high numbers of different attractors.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images02/sdm-100w-table-7-2.png}
\caption{Results generated by the framework similar from Kanerva's original Table 7.2. It was a 1,000 bit, 1,000,000 hard-location SDM with exactly 100 random bitstrings written into it.
\label{sdm-100w-table-7-2}}
\end{figure}

To obtain the results from Fig. \ref{sdm-10000w-table-7-2} and \ref{sdm-100w-table-7-2}, we had to write 10,000 random bitstrings to an SDM, and then randomly choose one of those bitstrings to be our origin. Finally, we randomly flipped some bits from the origin bitstring and executed a reading operation in the SDM. Thereby, in order to show the interaction effects more clearly, we wrote a handmade bitstring to the SDM which had all bits inverted in relation to the origin bitstring --- their hamming distance was equal to 1,000. Our handmade bitstring was acting as an opposite attractor, and one can see the accelerating effects towards convergence to both attractors: the origin and the handmade bitstrings (Fig. \ref{sdm-10000w-notX-table-7-2}). Here we had the exact same configuration of Figure \ref{sdm-10000w-table-7-2}, with the addition of the single opposite attractor.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images02/sdm-10000w-notX-table-7-2.png}
\caption{This graph shows the interaction effects more clearly.  As we include an opposite bitstring, one can see the accelerating effects towards convergence to both attractors: the origin and the opposite. Here we have the exact same configuration of Figure \ref{sdm-10000w-table-7-2}, with the addition of the single opposite attractor.
\label{sdm-10000w-notX-table-7-2}}
\end{figure}

Obviously, these small deviations from Kanerva's original theoretical predictions deserve a qualification.  Kanerva was working in the 1980s and the 1990s, and had no access to the immense computational power that we do today. It is no surprise that some small interaction effects should exist as machines allow us to explore the ideas of his monumental work.

  \caption{(a) and (b) show the behavior of a single read; (c) and (d) present the effects of 6 iterative reads. As stated previously, we can see a deterioration of convergence, with lower critical distance as $z>1$.  Another observation can be made here, concerning the discrepancy of Kanerva's Fig 7.3 and our data.  It seems that Kanerva may not have considered that a single read would only `clean' a small number of dimensions \emph{after the critical distance}. What we observe clearly is that with a single read, as the distance grows, the system only `cleans' towards the orthoghonal distance 500 after a number of iterative readings.}
  \label{fig:murillo-generalization-experiments}
\end{figure}

Physicist Paulo Murilo observed that the models of Kanerva-read ($z=1$) and Chada-read ($z=0$) were simple variations of the exponent $z$, which suggests experimenting with different values. The results, however, have not yielded performance improvements.  Though for $z \leq 1$ results are comparable to $z=1$, for $z>1$, the system shows a clear deterioration, with a smaller distance to convergence and higher divergence at large-distance reads. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:murillo-generalization-experiments}.



\section{Results (ii): Performance}

Our intention is to provide comparative performance metrics under different computation engines (CPU, GPU, etc) and different operating systems (Linux, MacOs, Windows, etc). Performance can be measured as the average number of scans of all hard locations per second, reads per second, writes per second, etc.

Our first device is a personal MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch Late 2013 with a 2.6GHz Intel core i5 processor, 6GB DDR3 RAM, and Intel Iris GPU.  We also intend to test on machines such as the iMac with dedicated GPU, MacPro with dedicated GPU, and personal computers under Linux with dedicated GPUs.

Beyond that, we are running as state-of-the-art devices: (i) an Amazon EC2 p3.xlarge with Intel Xeon E5-2686v4 processor, 61GB DDR3 RAM, and NVIDIA K80 GPU, and (ii) an Amazon EC2 p3.8xlarge with Intel Xeon E5-2686v4 processor, 488GB DDR3 RAM, and 8x NVIDIA K80 GPU.

  \caption{(a) and (b) show the behavior of the critical distance under Kanerva's model and the information-theoretic one, respectively.}
  \label{fig:info-theory-experiments}
\end{figure}


My advisor, Alexandre Linhares, has proposed another read operation: the weighted reading. In it, the sum of the counter's value is weighted based on the distance between the hard-location's address and the reading address. The logic behind it is to vary the importance of each hard-location inside the circle.  It is only natural that one encodes an item in near hard locations with a stronger signal, and a natural candidate for this signal function is the amount of information contained in the distance between the item and each hard location.  Closer hard locations have lower probabilies and therefore should encode more information. We know that the probability of a distance $d$ is $\binom{N}{d}/2^N$, and, acordingly, we have tested how SDM behaves when write weights are calculated using the amount of information given by each bitstring, i.e., $w(d) = -\log_2 \left( 2^{-N} \binom{N}{d} \right) = N - \log_2 \binom{N}{d}$, as in information theory \citep{cover2012elements}.

The results can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:info-theory-experiments} and seem promising. It seems that the critical distance increases by a number of bits.  Note that 10 additional bits imply an attractor $2^{10}$ of the size of the original. Another point to keep in mind is that, since the modulus of the vectors are not uniform in this approach, that the shape of the attractor may have large asymmetries.


\chapter{Conclusion}

Sparse Distributed Memory is a viable model of human memory, yet it does require researchers to (re-)implement a number of parallel algorithms in different architectures.

We propose to provide a new, open-source, cross-platform, highly parallel framework in which researchers may be able to create hypotheses and test them computationally through minimal effort. The framework is well-documented for public release at this time (http://sdm-framework.readthedocs.io), it has already served as the backbone of Chada's Ph.D. thesis. The single-line command ``pip install sdm'' will install the framework on posix-like systems, and single-line commands will let users test the framework, generate some of the figures from Kanerva's theoretical predictions in their own machines, and --- if interested enough ---, test their own theories and improve the framework, and the benchmarks used to evaluate the framework, in open-source fashion. It is our belief that such work is a necessary component towards accelerating research in this promising field.

We have generated a Docker image, which makes it even easier to explore the framework. After running the container, a Jupyter Notebook is available with sdm-framework and other tools already installed. The simulations run in this thesis are promptly available to be re-executed and explored. We invite the reader to take a look and explore a little bit.

% TODO Include in the to do list simulations based on the suggestion of Murilinho.
