\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) is a neuroscientific and psychologically
plausible model of human memory. In this paper we present an anomaly
between its previously theoretized behavior and its actual behavior,
and demonstrate that this anomaly is due to the autocorrelation involved
in the model. Our findings have systemwide implications for those
willing to implement and apply SDM in computational intelligence settings.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{S}{parse distributed memory} has been shown to be
fodastic.

In this paragraph we explain what SDM is.

  \caption{The value of the counters after $s=10,000$ writes shows the autocorrelation in the counters in autoassociative memories (``x at x''). The histogram was obtained through simulation. The red curve is the theoretical normal distribution found in equations (\ref{cntaddr1}) and (\ref{cntaddr0}).}

\caption{The threshold size $r$ of hard-locations bring about the autocorrelation of Theorem \ref{T1}. Consider, for instance, the extremes \{0, $n$\}.  Let us start with $n$ (in our case, $n=1000$ dimensions): given the information that $d(x,y)\le n$, the probability of a bitmatch in dimension $i$ is $1/2$; as $\forall x,y \in \{0, 1\}^N, d(x,y)\le n$. At the other extreme, consider that we have the information that $d(x,y)\le 0$: in this case $x=y$ and the probability of a bitmatch, in any dimension, is 1. The autocorrelation hence drops monotonically until convergence at $1/2$ as the distance grows. Numerically, our results converge to precisely $1/2$ only after $d(x,y)\ge 607$ for $n=1000$; $d(x,y)\ge 5332$ for $n=10000$, and $d(x,y)\ge 83$ for $n=100$. This will be seen in Lemma \ref{thm:sdm-access-radius}.

In this other paragraph we explain what the equator distance is.

Then, this introductory section breaks and moves on to the main findings
of this paper.
