[Thesis text....] ...As one can easily notice, we have got exactly the same curve as Kanerva. Both his and our model expect that, after reading, say, from 550 bits of distance from a written bitstring, we should obtain the $n/2$ equator distance. We have not, however.  This question has intrigued us, and here we look for a more analytic explanation than merely interference from the other written attractors. Let us turn back to mathematics to study this anomaly.
